# Earthquake-Significance_Predictor
Overview

This project utilizes machine learning to predict earthquake intensity based on user inputs such as distance from the epicenter, location type (rural/urban), and state. It provides personalized risk assessments and safety precautions to enhance earthquake preparedness.

Technologies Used

Python – Core programming language
Machine Learning (Scikit-Learn, TensorFlow) – Model training and prediction
Pandas & NumPy – Data processing and analysis
Flask/FastAPI – Backend API for predictions
Google Cloud Platform (GCP) – Cloud infrastructure and deployment
Kaggle Dataset – Training data for earthquake predictions
Matplotlib & Seaborn – Data visualization
SQLite/PostgreSQL – Database for storing user inputs and predictions
Features

Predicts earthquake intensity based on historical data
Provides personalized safety recommendations
Differentiates between rural and urban areas for better risk assessment
Future integration with insurance companies and building data for enhanced accuracy
